## Contributor guidelines

### Design

For the design work, please use the `design` branch of `edge/wallet`.

### Git commit format

We use semantic prefixes for commit messages. These include:

- `feat:` for features
- `fix:` for fixes
- `chore:` for chores
- `docs:` for docs
- `refactor:` for refactoring
- `debug:` for debugging
- `test:` for tests/test related commits

In addition to this, we use imperative messages, for example:

`feat: add create wallet functionality`

Finally, we keep all commit messages in lowercase, with no end of sentence punctuation.

### Vue/Tailwind CSS/Heroicons

For this and future web applications, we'll be using a combination of Vue 3, Tailwind CSS, and Heroicons. This application has been setup and configured for this, and should work out of the box.

Please use Tailwind CSS as much as possible for implementing the design. Where icons have been specified in the design, please find and use the most applicable icon from [Heroicons](https://heroicons.com/).

There are three npm scripts: `npm run dev`, `npm run build`, and of course `npm start`. The non-dev start script uses a local server, but working with the dev server should be sufficient.
